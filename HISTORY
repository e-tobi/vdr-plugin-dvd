    - fixed usage of DeviceClear ..
    - fixed variable osd position, regarding to video height 
    - needs vdr >= 1.2.6pre6 - no more extra STC patch !

2003-11-03: Version 0.3.4-rc9 .. sven at jausoft.com
    - bugfix: error introduced in rc8 are removed 
      (new threading errors) - menue navi is stable again.

2003-11-02: Version 0.3.4-rc8 .. sven at jausoft.com
    - bugfix: AudioSwitch had a bad thread deadlock,
              while using an audio plugin, e.g. bitstreamout.
	      After switching, audio was no more played.

2003-11-02: Version 0.3.4-rc7 .. sven at jausoft.com

    All Menue's with all sounds within Menue's should work now !
    Also any missed sync (Audio/Video/SPU) should being fixed !

    - using new sync code, with the new getSTC function
      therefore _you_have_to_ apply the patch:
	vdr-1.2.6-device-getSTC-v2.diff
      if not allready done (-> latest bitstreamout ) !!

    - the new a/v sync code does (simplified):
          delay_ticks (
		 (pktptsAudio-pktptsLastAudio)-(stcPTSAudio-stcPTSLastAudio ) )
	where pktpts is PTS of the stream
	and   stcPTS is PTS seen by the dvb device !
        therefore, we do usleep for this diff ticks we should had being passed.

    - cleaned up transition back to case where a DevicePlay/DeviceClear
      is needed (-> within Empty now )


2003-10-22: Version 0.3.4-rc6 .. sven at jausoft.com
    - added cPlayer default functions as well (AudioTrack..)
    - BITSTREAM
	- uses bitstreamout >= 0.48pre3

2003-10-14: Version 0.3.4-rc5 .. sven at jausoft.com
    - removed workarounds for vdr version < 1.2.6pre2 !

    - BITSTREAM
	- uses bitstreamout >= 0.47c

    - const int cDvdPlayer::MaxSubpStreams  = 16;
	- so hopefully 16 subtitles can be detected ..
    

2003-10-11: Version 0.3.4-rc4 .. sven at jausoft.com
    - BITSTREAM
	well, i got it to work well
	so the tee can be hot - no problem ;-)

	- made a stabilize bitstreamout-0.46g-jau01.patch,
	  read ths incl. ChangeLog !
  	  since this patch is not incl. within bitstreamout,
	  this patch is a MUST HAVE  !

	- understanding how bitstreamout works, 
 	  therefore simplifying the usage to a simple PlayAudio ;-)
	  the only difference to just PlayAudio is that we do not feed the
	  packet to another decoder ..

	- added an extra DeviceClear() at VTS_CHANGE,
	  so (especially AudioPlugins) can re-sync ..
  	  DeviceClear is called at any place it won't disturb ..
	  (manually switch track, audio, ..)

2003-10-11: Version 0.3.4-rc3 .. sven at jausoft.com
	- cleaned up Stop, no more hurting your ears on stopping plugin ;-)
		- still no audio after leaveing the plugin, any ideas ?

    	- cleaned up usage of clearSeenSubpStream(), clearSeenAudioTrack();
		- they do really clean up the lists,
		- they are called only if really intended ;-)

	- SPU fix:
		- cleared highlight button at startup (dvbspu.c)
		  bug workaround.
		  cDvbSpuDecoder::clearHighlight should set
		  hlpsize members to -1 !
		- fixed issue about:
			TV 4:3 DVD 16:9 Menu 4:3 -> cSpuDecoder::eSpuPanAndScan
		  the 16:9 flag is cleared out in this case - propper button pos. !

		- Tested with StarTrek - TheDirectorsCut - widescreeen Edition

	- BITSTREAM
		- bitstreamout plugin used only if avaiable and active
		- fixed the usage of PlayAudio -> bitstreamout,  
		  as seen in dvbplayer.c (StripAudioPackets)
			- index i was not used within "search" loop ..
	- BITSTREAM PROBLEM:
		- using the latest of all ;-)
		- bitstream out works sometimes, and sometimes not !
		- in the latter case, i have to restart vdr :-(
		- the not case:
			- other recordings running
			- previous menu struggle arround ..
			- the tee was a very hot one ;-)

	- Force DvdNavigation (-> or HowTo play DVD games ..)
		- Key 5  	DvdNavigationForce ON (not if progess display on)
		- Key Red  	Leave DvdNavigationForce
		- Assume you have a typical DVD game, so now you can
		  navigate it - see Keys above (-> README) !
		- Tested with DVD 
			Die Monster AG, BonusMaterial.BoosDoorGame, Track #15
